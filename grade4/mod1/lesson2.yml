      Interpret a multiplication equation as a comparison, e.g., 
      interpret 35 = 5 × 7 as a statement that 35 is 5 times as many as 7 and 7 times as many as 5. 
      Represent verbal statements of multiplicative comparisons as multiplication equations.

      Multiply or divide to solve word problems involving multiplicative comparison, 
      e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to 
      represent the problem, distinguishing multiplicative comparison from additive comparison

            Focus on visualizing the problem.
            Draw Ruby with her 3 cats.
            Think out loud: If Jane has 2 times as many cats as Ruby, who has more cookies? Jane. Let's write an equation that goes with this problem:
            2 X R = J
            Should we multiply or divide to solve?
            Draw Jane and represent 2 times as many by drawing 2 circles for the groups. Draw 3 cats in each group. Count how many cats Jane has and solve by multiplying 2 X 3 = 6.
            Fill in the target sentence we made in the beginning. Jane has 6 cats.
