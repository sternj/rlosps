      Interpret a multiplication equation as a comparison, e.g., 
      interpret 35 = 5 × 7 as a statement that 35 is 5 times as many 
      as 7 and 7 times as many as 5. Represent verbal statements of multiplicative comparisons as multiplication equations.
  - name: CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.4.OA.A.2
    text: >
      Multiply or divide to solve word problems involving multiplicative comparison, e.g., by using drawings and equations
      with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem, distinguishing multiplicative comparison from additive comparison.

      rows: 
        - teacher_role: Today, you will begin creating your final product on Scratch using the word problem visuals you created in the past lessons.
          student_role: Students should be sitting with their partner and gathering all materials from past lessons.
          check_for_understanding: Observe students as they get started- make sure they have everything they need.
        - check_for_understanding: Are students able to get right to work and login to Scratch on their own?
        - teacher_role: "Digital Citizenship Content Talking Point: Before we use our computers, I want to assure that we all know the expectations for using computers in our classroom."
          student_role: Students will turn and talk to discuss the Digital Citizenship Content Talking point before using their computers.
        - teacher_role: Have students T &T- What are some expectations that we should follow while using our computers? What does it look like?
          student_role: Students can use the visual of computer expectations created to remind them of how they should be using/treating their computers.
        - teacher_role: Come back together and discuss as a class.
          student_role: Students have the option to work on one computer and create one visual or share the visual and work together but create two separate projects in Scratch. (This allows them to be more creative if they want to use different sprites, etc.)
        - teacher_role: Create a visual of the computer expectations (e.g., anchor chart, copy of expectations in CS folder, etc.) to allow students to have access throughout the plugged lessons.
        - teacher_role: Digital Citizenship Talking Point- Now that we know our expectations for using our computers in the classroom, we can login to Scratch. When we are logging in, what are the two things that we need to do so? You’re right! We need to input our username and password.
          student_role: Students will turn and talk to discuss the Digital Citizenship Talking Point about the importance of having a secure password and not sharing their passwords with others.
        - teacher_role: Have students T & T- Why do we need passwords? How do you create a secure password? Why should you keep your password a secret?
        - teacher_role: Come back together and discuss as a class.
          student_role: Students should take out their checklist, so they make sure they complete each requirement. {rlm}[18](RLM)

            3. Type word problem into notes section of project.
            4. Share.
            5. Upload into Class Project Studio page.
