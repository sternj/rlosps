authors: Brianna Cicero & Lauren DiCarlo
editors: Allyson Leach & Sarah Vincent
content_area: Math
objectives:
  - Students will understand that an algorithm is a sequence of events by acting out an algorithm using block-based coding. (Lesson 1)
  - Students will create an algorithm on paper to represent and understand a multiplicative comparison word problem. (Lesson 2)
  - Students will learn how to code a multiplicative comparison word problem using block-based coding (Lesson 3)
  - Students will use inquiry to explore and learn about visual block-based coding. (Lessons 3-4)
  - Students will create algorithms using block-based coding on Scratch to code a visual of a multiplicative comparison word problem. (Lesson 4)
  - Students will use their knowledge of multiplicative comparison word problems and block-based coding to critique and debug the algorithm of another student's work. (Lesson 5)
